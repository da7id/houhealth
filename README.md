# HouHealth

*See it action: http://houhealth.com*

HouHealth is a webapp for viewing Houston's [publicly-available](data.ohouston.org) health code data.

[Houston loves eating out](http://houston.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/10-26-11-houston-still-the-undisputed-champion-in-eating-out-no-1-city-in-country-for-meals-out-per-week/), but it's tough to tell how your favorite restaurants fare in health inspections. HouHealth is a simple means of finding out!

I also wrote a short [blog post](http://mitchellbarron.io/houhealth) about my experience developing this project.
