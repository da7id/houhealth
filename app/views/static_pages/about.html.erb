<h3>About the App</h3>
<p>
  I like eating, especially in Houston. We've got a great food scene, but we lack transparency in health code inspections.
</p>

<p>
  When I found this dataset, I immediately started searching for my favorite restaurants (which was a much nastier experience than you see here). I built this app with the hope that other people would find the data as interesting as I did. Maybe the exposure will lead to safer practices in our restaurants.
</p>

<h3>About the Data</h3>
<p>
  This app was built with data made freely available via <a href="http://data.ohouston.org">Houston's data portal</a>. The data includes all health inspections conducted from 2012 through the first fiscal quarter of 2015.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

This site was built with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> handles the front-end, and it's deployed to a <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> droplet via <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">dokku</a>.
